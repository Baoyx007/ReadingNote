### what is difference between  fork /join framework and threadpool?分别适用于什么场景？ 

Fork/Join's logic is very simple: (1) separate (fork) each large task into smaller tasks; (2) process each task in a separate thread (separating those into even smaller tasks if necessary); (3) join the results.

It(Fork/Join) is designed for work that can be broken into smaller pieces recursively. The goal is to use all the available processing power to enhance the performance of your application.

可能适用于分治法
The Fork/Join framework introduced in Java 7 is actually an implementation of the **Divide and Conquer** algorithm (see Resources),

#### compare
Fork-join allows you to easily execute divide and conquer jobs, which have to be implemented manualy if you want to execute it in ExecutorService. In practice ExecutorService is usualy used to process many independent requests (aka transaction) concurrently, and fork-join when you want to accelerate one coherent job.

### 什么是work-stealing？适用于什么场景？在java中如何使用？
In parallel computing, work stealing is a scheduling strategy for multithreaded computer programs. 

In a work stealing scheduler, each processor in a computer system has a queue of work items (computational tasks, threads) to perform. Each work item consists of a series of instructions, to be executed sequentially, but in the course of its execution, a work item may also spawn new work items that can feasibly be executed in parallel with its other work. These new items are initially put on the queue of the processor executing the work item. When a processor runs out of work, it looks at the queues of other processors and "steals" their work items. In effect, work stealing distributes the scheduling work over idle processors, and as long as all processors have work to do, no scheduling overhead occurs.[1]

It is employed in the scheduler for the Cilk programming language,[3] the Java fork/join framework,[4] 

适用场景：
A thread starvation  occurs in a normal thread pool if all the threads in the pool are waiting for queued tasks in the same pool to complete.  ForkJoinPool avoids this problem by stealing work from other threads from inside the join() call, rather than simply waiting.

### CountDownLatch和CyclicBarrier有什么区别？适用于什么场景？
When using a CyclicBarrier, the assumption is that you specify the number of waiting threads that trigger the barrier. If you specify 5, you must have at least 5 threads to call await().

When using a CountDownLatch, you specify the number of calls to countDown() that will result in all waiting threads being released. This means that you can use a CountDownLatch with only a single thread.

### what is Amdahl's law？
Example 1
If 30% of the execution time may be the subject of a speedup, p will be 0.3; if the improvement makes the affected part twice faster, s will be 2. Amdahl's law states that the overall speedup of applying the improvement will be
$$
S_\text{latency} = \frac{1}{1 - p + \frac{p}{s}} = \frac{1}{1 - 0.3 + \frac{0.3}{2}} = 1.18.
