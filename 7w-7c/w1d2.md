java中除了内置锁synchronized，还在java.util.concurrent.atomic中提供了
-  ReetrantLock
-  atomic

### what is fair lock?
万不得已的必须要FairSync 的情况下才用 new ReentrantLock(true)。
因为会损失很多性能

### what is reentrantReadWriteLock ?
它包含一对锁：读锁和写锁。
Read/Write locks allow in multiple readers a the same time, we can get better concurrency, because the reader populations can proceed together.

跟细粒度的区分不同情况，可以获得更高的并发度

### what is atomicIntegerFieldUpdater
However AtomicInteger is significantly more resource intensive than a simple  volatile. If there are many instances of a class which has an AtomicInteger this increase in resource over a volatile can be significant.

The AtomicIntegerFieldUpdater comes to the rescue - it can be registered  with a volatile variable of a class and can then be used on multiple instances of the class.

If there are 1000s of instances of a class which would ordinarily have  AtomicInteger this can be a big saving.
